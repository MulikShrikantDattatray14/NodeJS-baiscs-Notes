Here’s a simplified and organized breakdown of the key concepts about **global variables** in Node.js and how to use them:

---

### 1. **Globals in Node.js**

Node.js provides a set of global variables that are always available throughout your application. These are different from browser-based global objects (like `window`), because **Node does not have a browser** or the `window` object. Instead, Node offers its own set of useful globals, which you can access in any part of your code.

### 2. **Key Global Variables in Node.js**

- **`__dirname`**:  
  This global variable provides the absolute path to the **current directory** where the current script is located.
  ```js
  console.log(__dirname);
  ```

- **`__filename`**:  
  This global variable provides the **full path** to the current **file** being executed.
  ```js
  console.log(__filename);
  ```

- **`require`**:  
  A function used to **import modules**. It allows you to load built-in modules or custom files in your application.
  ```js
  const fs = require('fs');  // Example: load the File System module
  ```

- **`module`**:  
  Provides information about the current module, including properties like `module.exports`, which you can use to export code from a module.
  ```js
  console.log(module);
  ```

- **`process`**:  
  Provides information about the **environment** in which the Node app is running. This is essential for building applications that run on different machines or environments (e.g., local vs production). The `process` object contains useful properties like:
  - `process.env`: Environment variables
  - `process.argv`: Command-line arguments
  - `process.exit()`: To exit the Node process
  ```js
  console.log(process.env);  // Environment variables
  console.log(process.argv); // Command-line arguments
  ```

- **`console`**:  
  Node.js provides access to the **console** globally, which you can use to log information to the terminal.
  ```js
  console.log("Hello, Node!");
  ```

- **`setInterval()` and `setTimeout()`**:  
  These globals allow you to run a function after a certain delay (`setTimeout`) or repeatedly at regular intervals (`setInterval`).
  ```js
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Hello every second!");
  }, 1000); // Prints "Hello every second!" every 1000ms (1 second)
  ```

---

### 3. **Running and Testing Node.js Code**

- To **run a Node.js program**, use the `node` command followed by the file name:
  ```bash
  node app.js
  ```

- You can **re-run** the same command by pressing the **up arrow key** in the terminal to bring up the last command, and then pressing **Enter** to execute it again.

- To **clear the terminal** screen, use the `clear` command (this is a terminal command, not Node-specific):
  ```bash
  clear
  ```

### 4. **Using Globals in Action**

Here’s an example of using some of the Node.js global variables together:

1. **Create a file `app.js`** with the following code:
   ```js
   console.log(__dirname);  // Current directory path
   console.log(__filename); // Current file name
   console.log(process.env); // Environment variables

   setInterval(() => {
     console.log("Hello every second!");
   }, 1000); // Repeated every 1 second
   ```

2. **Run the file** with:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

You’ll see output like:
```
/path/to/your/directory
/path/to/your/directory/app.js
{ ...environment variables... }
Hello every second!
Hello every second!
...
```

### 5. **Other Key Notes**

- **File Versioning**: Throughout this course, the instructor will save code examples in numbered files (e.g., `1-intro.js`). You can do the same, or simply copy/paste code into your own files for future reference.
  
- **No Need for `.js` Extension**: You can run Node.js programs without specifying the `.js` extension:
  ```bash
  node app
  ```

- **Handling `node` and File Extensions**: While you can omit `.js` when running files, for consistency, the instructor recommends using `.js` for clarity in the course.

---

### Key Takeaways

- Node.js has **global variables** like `__dirname`, `__filename`, `require`, and `process` that are always accessible and useful.
- You can run a Node.js file using `node <filename>`.
- The **`setInterval()`** and **`setTimeout()`** functions are available globally for time-based execution.
- As you progress through the course, you’ll get more hands-on experience with these globals in action.

With these **global variables** in Node.js, you're equipped with powerful tools to help manage your application’s environment, file paths, and modules.
