### Installing Packages Globally in Node.js

In this lesson, the instructor explains how to install packages globally using **npm** and outlines when and why it might be useful to do so. Additionally, they briefly discuss the emergence of **NPX** as an alternative for global installations.

### 1. **Installing a Package Globally**

To install a package globally with **npm**, the instructor reminds us of the correct command:

```bash
npm install -g <package-name>
```

For example, to install **`nodemon`** globally, you would run:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

- The `-g` flag indicates that the package should be installed globally, making it available across all your projects.
- On **macOS** (and some other systems), **sudo** may be required to grant administrator permissions:

```bash
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```

This command installs **nodemon** globally, meaning you can run it in any project without needing to install it locally each time.

### 2. **Why Install Packages Globally?**

The instructor gives a practical scenario to illustrate why installing a package globally might be useful:

- **Use Case**: If you have multiple Node.js projects (e.g., 20 different Node applications), and you're constantly working with **`nodemon`** (a tool that automatically restarts the app during development), installing **`nodemon`** globally simplifies your workflow. You don’t have to install it separately in each project.

#### **Example of Installing `nodemon` Globally**:

1. **Before Global Installation**:
   When **`nodemon`** is not installed globally, attempting to run the command will result in an error:

   ```bash
   command not found: nodemon
   ```

2. **After Global Installation**:
   After installing **`nodemon`** globally, you can use it in any of your projects, like so:

   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```

   This command will launch **`nodemon`** and automatically restart the app when changes are made to the files.

### 3. **Global Installation Use Cases (Gatsby & React)**

Global installations are particularly helpful when working with specific tools or frameworks that you need to run frequently across multiple projects. The instructor mentions two such examples:

1. **Gatsby CLI**:
   - **Gatsby**, a popular static site generator, requires the global installation of its CLI tool in order to create and manage Gatsby projects. You would install it globally like so:
     ```bash
     npm install -g gatsby-cli
     ```

2. **Create React App**:
   - Similarly, if you were working with **React** in the past, you needed to install **`create-react-app`** globally to quickly spin up new React projects. You would install it globally with:
     ```bash
     npm install -g create-react-app
     ```

---

### 4. **Shift to NPX and the End of Global Package Installation for Some Tools**

With the introduction of **NPX** in **npm 5.2**, global installations are becoming less necessary. **NPX** allows you to run CLI tools directly without installing them globally. This change helps avoid the issues that sometimes arise with global installations, such as version conflicts or permission errors.

#### **NPX Example: Create React App**:
Instead of installing **`create-react-app`** globally, you can now use **NPX** to create a React app directly:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-new-app
```

This approach:

- Eliminates the need to install the package globally.
- Ensures you're always using the latest version of the tool.
- Simplifies the process of setting up projects without cluttering your system with unnecessary global packages.

### 5. **Running Global Packages After Installation**

After installing **`nodemon`** globally, the instructor demonstrates how you can use it across any project without needing to install it locally each time.

#### **Running `nodemon` Globally**:
1. **After Global Installation**:
   You can simply run **`nodemon`** from any directory, and it will watch and restart your app:

   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```

   This avoids the need to add **`nodemon`** as a local dependency in every single project.

---

### 6. **Instructor’s Preference for Local Dependencies**

Although global installations can be very useful, the instructor shares a personal preference:

- **Personal Experience**: The instructor tends to avoid global packages because sometimes they cause issues for students (especially beginners who may encounter permission problems or version conflicts).
  
  - Instead, the instructor prefers to:
    - Use **NPX** for tools that don’t need to be installed globally.
    - Install dependencies **locally** within the project (even for tools like **`nodemon`**).

- This is not a rule but a personal preference, as global packages can occasionally cause problems for some users, especially in complex environments.

---

### 7. **What is NPX?**

NPX stands for **Node Package Execute** and is a tool introduced with **npm 5.2**. It allows you to run Node.js binaries (like CLI tools) without installing them globally.

- **Benefits of NPX**:
  - You can run CLI tools without cluttering your system with global packages.
  - Ensures you are using the latest version of the tool without worrying about outdated global installations.
  - Simplifies the process of using packages that are only needed occasionally.

#### **NPX Example**:
Instead of installing **`create-react-app`** globally, you can run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This command will use **NPX** to run the **`create-react-app`** CLI tool directly, fetching the latest version each time.

### 8. **Conclusion**

- **Global Installations**: Use **npm install -g** when you want to use a package across multiple projects without needing to install it every time (e.g., **`nodemon`**, **`gatsby-cli`**, **`create-react-app`**).
- **NPX**: With **NPX**, you can avoid installing tools globally and instead run them directly, always using the latest version. This has become the preferred method for many modern tools, such as **React** and **Gatsby**.
- **Personal Preference**: While global packages are helpful, the instructor prefers using **NPX** or **local dependencies** to avoid potential issues and ensure a cleaner development environment.

By using **NPX** and **local dependencies**, you can manage your projects more efficiently, avoiding the need for global installs unless absolutely necessary.
