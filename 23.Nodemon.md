### Installing and Using `nodemon` for Development

In this lesson, the instructor covers how to install **`nodemon`**, a useful tool for automatically restarting a Node.js application whenever files are modified. The focus is on installing it as a **devDependency** in your project and setting up custom **npm scripts** in **`package.json`** for easier management of your development workflow.

---

### 1. **What Is `nodemon`?**
- **`nodemon`** is a tool that automatically watches for changes in your application files and restarts the app when changes are detected.
- It saves time during development by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the app after each change (e.g., by typing `node app.js` every time).
- It's not needed in production environments, as production setups typically use more robust tools like **PM2** for app monitoring and restarting.

---

### 2. **Why Install `nodemon` as a Dev Dependency?**

The instructor emphasizes the importance of installing `nodemon` as a **devDependency** using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Alternatively, you can use `-D` as a shorthand for `--save-dev`:

```bash
npm install -D nodemon
```

#### Why use `devDependencies`?
- **Development only**: `nodemon` is a tool that is only necessary during the development phase. You don't need it in production.
- **Production-ready**: In production, tools like **PM2** will handle app restarts. `nodemon` is for convenience during the development process.
- **Other devDependencies**: This is the same for other tools used during development, such as testing libraries, linters, formatters, etc. You only want to include them as `devDependencies` because they are not needed when the app is running in a production environment.

#### How it works:
- **`devDependencies`** are installed with the `npm install` command, but they will not be installed when the app is installed on a production server using `npm install --production`.

### 3. **Setting Up NPM Scripts**

Next, the instructor demonstrates how to define custom scripts in the **`package.json`** file to automate running commands.

- **Scripts Object**: In **`package.json`**, the `"scripts"` property allows you to define custom commands that can be run using **`npm run <script>`**.
  
#### Example 1: The `start` Script

You can define a `start` script that runs your application using **`node`**:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Now, instead of typing `node app.js` in the terminal, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically run **`node app.js`** for you, simplifying the command.

#### Example 2: The `dev` Script (with `nodemon`)

The instructor introduces the **`dev`** script, which uses **`nodemon`** to restart the app automatically when changes are made. The `dev` script looks like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
}
```

To run your app in development mode with **`nodemon`**, you can now use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts **`nodemon`** instead of **`node`**, and it will restart the app whenever files are modified.

---

### 4. **Testing the Setup**

Once **`nodemon`** is installed and the scripts are configured, you can test the setup:

1. **Run the `dev` script**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start **`nodemon`**, and you'll see output indicating that **`nodemon`** is watching your app for changes.

2. **Make a change to the application**:
   For example, change the text in your code:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Hello People');
   ```
   When you save the file, **`nodemon`** will automatically restart the app and print the updated message in the terminal.

   This is the core benefit of **`nodemon`** â€” no more manually restarting your app!

---

### 5. **Optional Customization**

If you prefer, you can skip defining the **`dev`** script in **`package.json`** and run **`nodemon`** directly from the command line:

```bash
nodemon app.js
```

However, defining the script in **`package.json`** makes it easier for others to use and ensures a consistent development setup across your team.

---

### 6. **Summary of Key Points**

1. **What is `nodemon`?**
   - `nodemon` is a development tool that automatically restarts your Node.js app when files change, saving you the hassle of manually stopping and restarting the app.

2. **Installing `nodemon` as a devDependency**:
   - Install it with `npm install --save-dev nodemon` to ensure it's only available during development, not in production.

3. **Setting up npm scripts**:
   - Use the `"scripts"` section in **`package.json`** to define commands like `npm start` (for running the app with `node`) and `npm run dev` (for running the app with `nodemon`).

4. **Testing the setup**:
   - Run the app using **`npm run dev`** and make changes to your code to see **`nodemon`** automatically restart the app.

5. **Why `devDependencies`?**
   - Keep development tools like `nodemon` in **`devDependencies`** to avoid bloating your production environment with unnecessary tools.

---

### 7. **Conclusion**

By using **`nodemon`** in combination with **npm scripts**, you can significantly improve your development workflow. **`nodemon`** helps automate the process of restarting your application when you modify files, and **npm scripts** simplify running commands. Remember, **`nodemon`** is a development-only tool, so it should be installed as a **devDependency**, and you should not push it to production environments.
