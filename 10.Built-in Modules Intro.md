### Summary:

In this part of the lesson, the instructor is introducing the concept of **built-in modules** in Node.js, emphasizing that Node comes with several pre-made modules that can help you build powerful applications without reinventing the wheel. These modules include things like handling files, working with the operating system, and setting up web servers.

### Key Points:

1. **Modules in Node.js**: 
   - So far, we’ve learned how to create our own simple modules, like the `sayHi` function. However, **Node.js provides many built-in modules** that are far more useful and feature-rich. These modules are created by experienced developers and cover a wide range of functionalities.

2. **Built-in Node.js Modules**:
   - The instructor lists a few key modules we’ll cover in upcoming lessons:
     - **OS Module**: Provides information about the operating system.
     - **Path Module**: Helps with working with file and directory paths.
     - **File System (FS) Module**: Allows interaction with the file system, like reading and writing files.
     - **HTTP Module**: Used for creating HTTP servers to handle web requests.

3. **Why Not Cover Every Built-in Module?**:
   - Node has many built-in modules, each with **multiple methods and properties**. If we were to cover **every module** and its features in depth, it would take up a lot of time, and it wouldn’t be the most efficient approach for the course.
   - Instead, the instructor suggests that we’ll focus on the **most important modules and their key features** for now, and as the course progresses, we will **introduce more modules** as we need them for specific tasks.

4. **Further Exploration**:
   - If you’re curious about any built-in module or want to dive deeper into how it works, the instructor encourages you to check out the **Node.js documentation**.
   - You can go to the official Node.js docs online, find the module you're interested in, and learn more about its methods and properties.
   - The instructor mentions they will be using **Node.js version 14** for this course, but you can also access documentation for older versions.

5. **Node.js Documentation**:
   - The Node.js documentation is an excellent resource for exploring all the modules and understanding their methods in detail. It’s available on the Node.js website (nodejs.org).
   - If you enjoy reading documentation, you can spend a lot of time exploring and learning about each module’s functionality.

### Conclusion:
The instructor introduces the idea that while Node has a lot of built-in modules, we will focus on the most commonly used ones for now. As we continue with the course, we’ll explore these modules in more detail, and for those interested in learning more, the official Node.js documentation is always available to explore further.
