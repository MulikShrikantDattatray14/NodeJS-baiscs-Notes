### Using NPM in Your Project: Installation and Dependency Management

In this lesson, the instructor walks us through the basics of using **NPM (Node Package Manager)** to install dependencies into a project. This involves understanding how to install packages both **locally** and **globally**, and setting up the necessary configuration for managing dependencies in your Node.js projects.

### 1. **Getting Started with NPM**

The instructor begins by reminding us that **NPM** is installed automatically when you install **Node.js**. This makes it easy to use right away in your projects.

You can check the version of NPM installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm --version
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand version:

```bash
npm -v
```

This will output the installed version of NPM. It's important to note that the version of NPM may not match the version of Node.js. This is perfectly normal, as Node and NPM are separate tools, and NPM can evolve independently.

### 2. **Local vs. Global Installation of Packages**

The instructor then explains the two main ways to install dependencies with NPM:

#### **Local Installation (Recommended for Project Dependencies)**
- **Local dependencies** are packages that you install specifically for a **single project**. They are placed in the `node_modules` folder inside your project directory.
  
- To install a local dependency, use the following command:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

For example, if you want to install **Bootstrap** or **Express**, you would run:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
npm install express
```

This command installs the package only for the current project and adds it to your `package.json` file (which we'll set up in the next video).

#### **Global Installation (For Utilities and Tools)**
- **Global dependencies** are installed so they can be used across **any project** on your system. These are often command-line tools or utilities that you may need for development (e.g., linters, compilers, or utilities like **nodemon**).

- To install a package globally, you would add the `-g` flag to the install command:

```bash
npm install -g <package-name>
```

For example, to install **nodemon** globally (a tool that automatically restarts your server when files change), you would run:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

On **macOS** and other Unix-based systems, you may be prompted to enter **sudo** (administrator) credentials when installing packages globally:

```bash
sudo npm install -g <package-name>
```

### 3. **Why Focus on Local Dependencies?**

The instructor suggests that **local dependencies** are the most commonly used and should be your primary focus. While you can install packages globally, **npx** (a tool introduced with Node.js 8.2) has made global installations less necessary. **npx** allows you to run commands from packages without installing them globally, which simplifies package management.

### 4. **Setting Up Project Dependencies**

Before jumping into installing packages, the instructor emphasizes that there's one more step to prepare your project for managing dependencies. This step involves setting up a `package.json` file, which acts as the metadata for your project. It keeps track of the installed dependencies, their versions, and other important project details.

The instructor teases that in the **next video**, they will show us how to set up this configuration file and prepare our project for installing dependencies.

Once we have the `package.json` set up, we’ll be able to install **any package we need** and manage our project’s dependencies efficiently.

### 5. **Next Steps**

- In the next video, we’ll take care of setting up the **`package.json`** file so we can manage our project dependencies properly.
- Once that’s done, we’ll be able to install packages for our project, use them, and keep track of them in our `package.json` file.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to use **NPM** to install both **local** and **global** dependencies into our projects. We also learned the difference between the two and why local installations are generally preferred for project dependencies.

Key takeaways:
- **Local dependencies** are installed for a specific project and stored in the `node_modules` directory.
- **Global dependencies** are available system-wide and are used for utilities or tools.
- Use `npm install <package-name>` for local installs, and `npm install -g <package-name>` for global installs.
- **npx** reduces the need for global dependencies by allowing you to run packages without installing them.

Now, we’re ready to set up our project’s **`package.json`** file and start installing packages that will help us build our applications.
