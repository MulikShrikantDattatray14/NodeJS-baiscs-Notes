### Summary:

In this section, the instructor introduces a specific **built-in module** in Node.js, the **OS module**, which provides methods to interact with the operating system. The instructor demonstrates how to use this module to get system-related information such as user info, system uptime, and memory stats. The goal is to show how to interact with built-in modules in Node.js and explore their capabilities.

### Key Points:

1. **Starting the Example**:
   - The instructor begins by referring to the previously mentioned file `modules.js` and prepares to set up a new example from scratch.
   - All the necessary code (like the `sayHi` function) is copied into this new `modules.js` file, which will be used for the demonstration.
   - The `app.js` file will reference this new `modules.js` file using `require`.

2. **Introduction to the OS Module**:
   - The **OS module** is built into Node.js and provides a set of methods and properties to interact with the operating system, such as retrieving information about the current user, system uptime, memory usage, and more.
   - The general setup for using a built-in module like `os` is:
     - **Import the module** using `require('os')`.
     - **Access its methods and properties** either by calling them directly through the `os` variable or by destructuring specific methods.

3. **Using the OS Module**:

   - **User Information**:
     - The `userInfo()` method of the `os` module provides information about the current user (e.g., home directory, shell).
     - Example:
       ```js
       const os = require('os');
       const user = os.userInfo();
       console.log(user);
       ```
       Running this will print information about the current user, such as the username, home directory, and shell used.

   - **System Uptime**:
     - The `uptime()` method returns the number of seconds the system has been running.
     - Example:
       ```js
       console.log(`The System Uptime is: ${os.uptime()} seconds`);
       ```
       This will log the system uptime in seconds.

   - **Memory Information**:
     - The `totalmem()` method returns the total amount of system memory (in bytes).
     - The `freemem()` method returns the amount of free system memory (in bytes).
     - Example:
       ```js
       console.log(`Total Memory: ${os.totalmem()} bytes`);
       console.log(`Free Memory: ${os.freemem()} bytes`);
       ```

   - **Combining Multiple Methods**:
     - The instructor shows how to store multiple pieces of information from the `os` module in an object for easier reference and later use.
     - Example:
       ```js
       const current = {
         name: os.type(),
         release: os.release(),
         totalMem: os.totalmem(),
         freeMem: os.freemem()
       };
       console.log(current);
       ```
       This will log an object containing system details like the OS type, release version, total memory, and free memory.

4. **Running the Code**:
   - After adding the code to the `app.js` file, the instructor runs the Node.js application (`node app.js`), which prints all the system information to the console, such as user info, uptime, and memory stats.

5. **Final Thoughts on Built-in Modules**:
   - The instructor emphasizes that **Node.js built-in modules** like the `os` module are very powerful, and there are many more methods and properties available in each module than whatâ€™s shown here.
   - The key takeaway is not to cover every method in detail but to **demonstrate how to use these modules** to interact with your system and perform common tasks easily.

### Example Code (as discussed):

```js
// Import the OS module
const os = require('os');

// Get current user information
const user = os.userInfo();
console.log(user); // Logs information like username, home directory, shell

// Get system uptime (how long the system has been running in seconds)
console.log(`The System Uptime is: ${os.uptime()} seconds`);

// Get total and free system memory
console.log(`Total Memory: ${os.totalmem()} bytes`);
console.log(`Free Memory: ${os.freemem()} bytes`);

// Create an object with more system info
const current = {
  name: os.type(), // Operating system type (e.g., 'Linux', 'Darwin')
  release: os.release(), // OS version
  totalMem: os.totalmem(), // Total memory
  freeMem: os.freemem() // Free memory
};
console.log(current); // Logs an object with the system information
```

### Conclusion:
The instructor demonstrates how easy it is to use built-in modules in Node.js, such as the **OS module**, to retrieve useful system information like user details, uptime, and memory usage. These modules provide powerful functionality out of the box, and you can quickly leverage them in your applications. The key takeaway is understanding how to **import and use these modules** effectively to interact with the underlying operating system.
