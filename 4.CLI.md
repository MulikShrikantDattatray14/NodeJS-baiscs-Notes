Here's a simplified and organized summary of how to create and run a basic Node.js application:

---

### 1. **Creating a New Node.js Project**

1. **Create a Folder for Your Project**:
   - On your desktop, create a new folder called `tutorial` (or any name you prefer).

2. **Open Your Text Editor**:
   - Use your preferred text editor, like **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Drag the `tutorial` folder into your text editor to open it.

3. **Create a JavaScript File**:
   - Inside the folder, create a new file named `app.js` (you can choose any name).

---

### 2. **Write a Simple Node.js Program**

1. **Define a Variable**:
   - In `app.js`, define a variable called `amount`:
     ```js
     const amount = 12;
     ```

2. **Add a Conditional Statement**:
   - Use an `if` statement to check if `amount` is less than 10. If it is, log `"small number"`, otherwise log `"large number"`:
     ```js
     if (amount < 10) {
       console.log("small number");
     } else {
       console.log("large number");
     }
     ```

3. **Add a Final Log**:
   - Add a `console.log` to indicate that the program is running:
     ```js
     console.log("hey, it's my first node app");
     ```

---

### 3. **Run Your Node.js Program**

#### **Option 1: Using Terminal (Command-Line Interface)**

1. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where `app.js` is located. Use the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/tutorial
     ```
   - You can drag and drop the folder into the terminal to quickly navigate to it.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - In the terminal, run your program using the command:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
   - This will execute the JavaScript file, and you should see the output:
     ```
     large number
     hey, it's my first node app
     ```

3. **Modify the Program**:
   - Change the value of `amount` (e.g., set it to `9`), then run the program again:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
   - Now you should see:
     ```
     small number
     hey, it's my first node app
     ```

#### **Option 2: Using Integrated Terminal in VS Code**

1. **Open the Integrated Terminal**:
   - In **Visual Studio Code**, open the integrated terminal by pressing **Ctrl + `** (Control + tilde) or by navigating to **View > Terminal**.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Once the terminal is open, it should already be pointing to your project folder (`tutorial`).
   - Simply run:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - You’ll get the same output as in the regular terminal:
     ```
     large number
     hey, it's my first node app
     ```

### Key Takeaways

- **Create a Folder**: Start by creating a new folder for your project.
- **Write Code in `.js` File**: Write JavaScript code (e.g., defining variables, adding conditionals).
- **Run Code Using Node**: Execute your file with `node <filename>.js` in the terminal.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Use Visual Studio Code’s built-in terminal to run your code directly without navigating through the folder in a separate terminal window.
