### Understanding the Event Loop in Node.js: Code Examples

In this section, we'll explore some practical code examples to see the **Event Loop** in action. These examples will help you understand how asynchronous operations work in Node.js and how tasks are handled by the event loop. If you need the code, it’s available in the event loop example directory in the course repository.

Let's dive into a few key examples, including reading a file asynchronously, using `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and handling an HTTP server.

---

### Example 1: Asynchronous File Reading

We begin with a simple asynchronous file reading operation using Node.js's `fs.readFile` method. This method reads files asynchronously, meaning it doesn't block the rest of the code execution while waiting for the file to be read.

#### Code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Started our task');

fs.readFile('first-file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('First result:', data);
  }
});

console.log('Started next task');
```

#### What Happens:
1. **`console.log('Started our task')`** runs first.
2. The `fs.readFile` function is called to read `first-file.txt`. This operation is asynchronous, so Node.js offloads this task to the **file system** and continues executing the code.
3. **`console.log('Started next task')`** runs immediately after the `fs.readFile` is called, without waiting for the file to be read.
4. When the file is read, the callback function is triggered, and the file content is logged: **`First result: <file contents>`**.
5. Finally, the message **`Completed the first task`** appears once the file reading is complete.

#### Key Concept:
The asynchronous `fs.readFile` does not block the execution of the next task. The event loop **offloads** the task (file reading) and only calls the callback when the task is complete.

---

### Example 2: Using `setTimeout`

This is a typical example used to demonstrate how asynchronous operations work with **delayed execution**. Here, we use `setTimeout` to execute a callback function after a delay.

#### Code:

```javascript
console.log('First');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Second');
}, 0);

console.log('Third');
```

#### What Happens:
1. **`console.log('First')`** is executed immediately.
2. **`setTimeout`** is called with a delay of `0ms`. The callback is added to the event queue, but it is **not executed immediately**. Instead, it is placed in the **event loop** and will run after all synchronous tasks are completed.
3. **`console.log('Third')`** is executed immediately after `setTimeout` is called.
4. Finally, after the synchronous code finishes, the callback inside `setTimeout` is executed, and **`Second`** is printed.

#### Output:
```
First
Third
Second
```

#### Key Concept:
Even though the delay is set to `0ms`, the callback from `setTimeout` does not run until the synchronous code (i.e., `console.log('First')` and `console.log('Third')`) has finished. This demonstrates how **asynchronous functions** are offloaded to the event loop.

---

### Example 3: Using `setInterval`

The next example introduces **`setInterval`**, which is similar to `setTimeout`, but instead of running the callback once, it repeats the callback at regular intervals.

#### Code:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

let counter = 0;

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval', counter++);
  if (counter === 5) {
    clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the interval after 5 iterations
    console.log('Interval cleared');
  }
}, 1000);

console.log('Set interval, waiting for results');
```
```javascript
Ouput : 


Start
Set interval, waiting for results
Interval 0
Interval 1
Interval 2
Interval 3
Interval 4
Interval cleared

```
#### What Happens:
1. **`console.log('Start')`** is printed immediately.
2. `setInterval` is called with a 1-second delay (`1000ms`). It begins executing the callback every second.
3. Every 1 second, the callback logs the interval count: **`Interval 0`, `Interval 1`, etc.**
4. After 5 iterations, `clearInterval` stops the interval.
5. **`console.log('Interval cleared')`** is printed once the interval is cleared.

#### Key Concept:
- The event loop keeps the process alive to allow `setInterval` to continue executing at regular intervals. Unlike `setTimeout`, which executes once and then exits, **`setInterval`** keeps running until explicitly stopped.

- This example also demonstrates how the event loop manages repetitive tasks asynchronously, with the process remaining alive while the intervals continue.

### Example 4: Node.js HTTP Server

Let’s take a look at how the event loop works with **HTTP servers** in Node.js. A server listens for incoming requests, processes them asynchronously, and responds to them.

#### Code:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log('Request event');
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 5000');
});
```

#### What Happens:
1. **`server.listen(5000)`** tells Node.js to start listening for incoming requests on port 5000. This is an **asynchronous** operation, so the event loop continues to run while waiting for requests.
2. When a request comes in, the **callback** (provided to `createServer`) is invoked.
3. **`console.log('Request event')`** is printed each time a request is received.
4. **`res.end('Hello World')`** sends the response to the client.
5. The server stays alive, awaiting future requests. The event loop keeps it running even after handling a request.

#### Key Concept:
The HTTP server's `listen` function is asynchronous, meaning it does not block the event loop. It simply tells the event loop to keep running and handle any incoming requests. The server remains alive and responsive, processing each request when it arrives.

---

### Example 5: Comparing `setTimeout` vs `setInterval`

Now, let’s compare the behavior of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` by running the examples consecutively.

#### Code:

```javascript
// setTimeout Example
console.log('Start setTimeout');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout executed');
}, 0);

console.log('End setTimeout');

// setInterval Example
console.log('Start setInterval');

let counter = 0;
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval executed', counter++);
  if (counter === 3) {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    console.log('Interval cleared');
  }
}, 1000);

console.log('End setInterval');
```


```javascript

Output : 

Start setTimeout
End setTimeout
Start setInterval
End setInterval
Timeout executed
Interval executed 0
Interval executed 1
Interval executed 2
Interval cleared

```
#### What Happens:
1. **`setTimeout`** prints "Start setTimeout" and "End setTimeout" immediately, and then "Timeout executed" after all synchronous code finishes.
2. **`setInterval`** starts executing its callback every second, printing `"Interval executed 0"`, `"Interval executed 1"`, and `"Interval executed 2"`, then clears itself after 3 executions.

#### Key Concept:
- `setTimeout` executes a **single callback** after the specified time (in this case, `0ms`), while `setInterval` executes a **callback repeatedly** at the specified interval.
- Both of them offload tasks to the event loop, allowing the process to continue handling other operations while waiting for these asynchronous operations to complete.

### Conclusion: The Event Loop in Action

Through these examples, we can clearly see the **event loop** at work:

- **Asynchronous operations** (e.g., `fs.readFile`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and HTTP server requests) are offloaded by the event loop, which ensures that Node.js doesn’t block on time-consuming tasks.
- The **event loop** allows the server or application to remain responsive and process multiple requests concurrently.
- **Synchronous code** runs first, while asynchronous tasks are placed in the event queue and executed only when the synchronous tasks are complete.
  
Understanding the event loop and how it works with asynchronous functions is a fundamental part of developing efficient, non-blocking applications in Node.js.
