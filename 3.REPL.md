Here’s a simplified, organized summary of how to get started with **Node.js** and the two ways to run code in Node:

### Running Code in Node.js

After installing Node.js, you need to know how to run your JavaScript code. In Node, there are two main ways to execute code:

1. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**  
2. **CLI (Command-Line Interface) Executable**

### 1. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**

- **What is it?**  
  - The REPL is an interactive environment for running JavaScript code. It reads, evaluates, prints, and then loops back for more input.
  - It’s useful for testing small pieces of code or experimenting.

- **How to use it?**
  1. Open the **terminal**.
  2. Type `node` and press **Enter** (without any additional arguments).
  3. You'll enter the REPL environment, indicated by a `>` prompt.

- **Example in REPL**:
  ```js
  const name = "John";
  console.log(name);  // Output: John
  ```

- **When to use it?**
  - The REPL is great for testing simple ideas or snippets of code, but it’s not meant for writing full applications.
  
- **How to exit the REPL**:
  - Press **Ctrl + C** twice to exit the REPL.

### 2. **CLI (Command-Line Interface) Executable**

- **What is it?**
  - The CLI is how you run full Node.js applications. Instead of interacting line-by-line like the REPL, you run a complete **JavaScript file**.
  - This is the preferred method for building real Node.js applications.

- **How to use it?**
  1. Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `app.js`.
  2. In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
  3. This will execute the code in `app.js`.

- **When to use it?**
  - Use the CLI for running full Node.js applications, scripts, or anything beyond testing small code snippets.

### Key Takeaways

- **REPL** is for quick, interactive testing of small bits of code (like a browser’s developer console).
- **CLI** is for running full applications and scripts—this will be your main tool for Node development.

With this, you should be ready to start writing and executing Node.js code, whether you're testing ideas in the REPL or building full applications via the CLI.
