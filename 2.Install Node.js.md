### Steps to Install Node.js

1. **Go to the Node.js Website**:
   - Navigate to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Choose the LTS Version**:
   - Select the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for stability, especially for production apps.
   - The website will show you two options: LTS (recommended) and Current. Choose **LTS**.

3. **Download and Install**:
   - Click on the LTS button to download the installer for your operating system.
   - Open the downloaded file and go through the installation steps:
     - Click **Continue** on each screen.
     - Agree to the terms and click **Install**.
     - You may be prompted to enter your computer's **password** to complete the installation.

4. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After the installation is complete, open your **terminal**.
   - Type the command:  
     ```bash
     node --version
     ```
   - If everything is installed correctly, you should see the **Node version number** (e.g., `v14.x.x`).

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

- **If You Don’t See the Version**:  
   - If the command `node --version` doesn’t show a version number, the installation may have failed.
   - **Do not panic**. Instead, search for solutions online. You’ll likely find specific solutions based on the error you’re facing. A quick search on your favorite search engine should help.

- **Node Version**:
   - At the time of the recording, Node.js version 14 (LTS) was recommended.
   - If you are installing **in the future**, your version number will likely be higher than 14.
   - **Use the latest LTS version** available for stability.
   - The course will work fine with the most current LTS version, and if any issues arise, they will be addressed in future updates.
